			<h2>Common Misconceptions and Myths About Trafficking</h2>
			<ul>
				<li class = 'sub1'>
					Misconceptions:
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub2'>
							Prostitution is thought to be a victimless crime. 
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li class = 'sub3'>
								Although victims of prostitution may seem to be willing to do this promoting the idea that this is a victimless crime, in reality they resent both the person exploiting them. 
								Even though you yourself may find it easy to say that you would never do this, victims of exploitation are adolescents and teenagers who may be vulnerable due to various sources such as mental and physical vulnerabilities.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub2'>
							Teenagers that have been prostituted are not victims, they are bad kids.
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li class = 'sub3'>
								One may say that a teenager that had been prostituted was due to their decision. However, most children who are prostituted are usually coerced or forced into. Even if the teenager did willingly choose it, they are not legally old enough to make a decision.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				<li class = 'sub1'>
					Myths:
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						All victims of child sex trafficking are girls.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							Common stereotypes and other reasons may lead you to believe this may be true, however in reality, almost 50% of all victims may be male. We do not usually hear about this portion of victims mainly because of this myth itself promoting a stigma for being a boy and a victim as well as being seen as a homosexual. Boys are also vulnerable to being trafficked to obtain necessities such as money, food, shelter or even because they were thrown out of their homes for being gay or transgender.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						Prostituted adolescents and teenagers can leave whenever they want.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							In most cases where this is said, the entire picture is not considered. Victims of prostitution may fear the police after having broken some laws while with their trafficker and may be reluctant to return home out of shame and guilt as well. Traffickers may also brand victims with tattoos providing a feeling of possession by the trafficker. Victims may also love or have compassion with their trafficker tricking them into remaining as a victim through a psychological syndrome called the Stockholm Syndrome.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li class = 'sub1'>
					Realities about Trafficking:
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						Homelessness increases vulnerability and homeless youth are at risk.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							Throughout the nation, there is a gigantic gap between the amount of beds available for the homeless and the homeless themselves. In addition, lack of resources for education or survival may lead to vulnerabilities in these groups.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						Even without a trafficker, prostitution of children is still exploitation.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							Even though there are some victims who do not have a trafficker, money isn't necessarily earned. Victims may exchange sex for food or shelter and may be considered a rape victim if the victim is 15 years or younger. However, with sufficient evidence of an exchange, it may not be considered rape anymore.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						Prostituted children do not make a lot of money, they are often destitute.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							Although victims involved in sex trafficking exploited for money, victims are forced to hand it over to their traffickers and do not control it.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>	
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						Children play a major role in the sex trade.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							Since 2003, the FBI and other government agencies have rescued more than 3600 children from prostitution and convicted over 1600 traffickers.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						Human trafficking happens here in the United States.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							Believe it or not, trafficking afflicts everyone. Social status and culture are no boundaries for traffickers and victims do not even need to transfer between states or nations to be a victim, it can happen within their state.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class = 'sub2'>
						Human trafficking is very common.
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li class = 'sub3'>
							Within the United States, human trafficking ranks number two as the most popular illegal trade and is rapidly growing where it is expected to outpace drug trade in a few years. Drug sellers are also switching over to trafficking as it is viewed as a safer way to earn profits.
